                    <h1>Our Vision and Mission</h1>
                    <p>

                        <b>Our mission</b> is to provide reliable and high quality driving to our customers in all seasons with the fact that our durable tires, which we have produced together with technology in an evolving era, have the maximum level of road holder feature that prevents the vehicle from slipping.

                    <h1>PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY</h1>
                    <p>
                        <b>There are 5 stages of our products.</b></br>
                        <br>
                        <b>1. Core benefit:</b> Being able to drive a car.
                        <br>
                        <b>2. Basic product:</b> Tire for driving a car.
                        <br>
                        <b>3. Expected product:</b> Thanks to its product quality, reliability and innovative features, it meets more of the features that customers expect from a tire.
                        <br>
                        <b>4. Augmented product:</b> Our company sells according to the seasonal conditions of many countries and regions. Winter tires are sold to winter-intensive regions, while summer or all-season tires are sold to hot regions.
                        <br>
                        <b>5. Potential product:</b> Exploring new ways to provide a more reliable ride to our customers with technology and to achieve this with minimal damage to nature.

                <div class="about-description-footer">
                    <h1>PRICE STRATEGY</h1>
                    <p>
                        As a price strategy in our products, we apply psychology pricing. For example, by setting the price to $119.99 instead of $120, we create an illusion on the customer's side. We also increase our sales amount by providing discounts or quantity discount at certain periods. At the same time, we give our customers the gift of warranty and service for 6 months to those who buy full set tires and rim. We apply product-form pricing status according to different specifications and versions of the product.
                    </p>

                <div class="about-description-footer">
                    <h1>PROMOTION STRATEGY</h1>
                    <p>
                    Promotion strategy is based on marketing communications. As an <b>AUTON</b> Tire company, we first identified our target audience. We have built brand awareness, which allows the consumer to recognize and remember our brand. After that, we expressed our communication and advertising in a clear, simple and expressive language to promote our brand and products. As a communication channel; we preferred to use online media such as e-mail, websites, social media and visual media such as billboards, posters. For <b>AUTON</b>, we attach importance to high credibility. For this reason, our main target audience is customers who focus on product features and news. As a sales promotion, we aim to increase our sales and profit rates by making promotions to encourage our consumers to buy our products at certain periods. Our company uses both the pull and push strategy. The push strategy is applied because the product is sold face-to-face and directed to channel members through commercial promotion. The pull strategy is applied because advertising strategies and sales promotions are carried out, which include promotion by mass media.

                    <h1>DISTRIBUTION STRATEGY</h1>
                    <p>
                        We use the indirect distribution strategy in our project. This strategy is to have intermediary institutions such as wholesalers, retailers, sales representatives with economic independence, brokers between the producer and the consumer. The most important values that this adds to us are:
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                    • Since these intermediaries are in direct and regular contact with consumers, they both sell for us and provide accurate and valuable feedback for manufacturers.
                    <br>
                    • They assist the market in the process of creating new products
                    <br>
                    • Promoting the product/products in their own region is another function performed by the intermediaries. Many design their own sales incentive programs aimed at generating customer traffic at other outlets.
